The fingerprint data matched with Retired Sergeant Robert Gordon, of the prestigious 107th Infantry Regiment. His address:  4086 Adams Drive Houston, TX 77099 Now is the moment of truth. 10 years of an excruciating manhunt, all leading up to this. The FBI calls in the Rapid Action Task Force and surrounds Cooper’s home. They barge into the house and see Cooper enjoying the same drink he had ordered all these years ago. The calmness still intact on his ageing face, he asks the senior officers to take a seat. Without any undue pressure, he narrates his tale that had kept the world curious. Gordon: “Care for a hot Brandy, gentlemen? Anyway, I’ll spare you the extra trouble. I did what I had to; my Lily is at peace now. Your flaw-ridden system has already cost me enough; first my leg, and then my Lily. This country just knows money and profit. The cost of human life here is like peanuts. I have nothing else to say.” FBI Officer: “Sergeant, don’t make us force you. You have cooperated till now, might as well narrate the entire tale as it happened. It’s over now.” Sergeant: “So be it! The aviation sector has been favoured heavily by the Senators and Politicians, and while they kept building newer airports, they overlooked the securities of the existing ones! Be it the faulty plane designs, or the loose security; the loopholes always kept deepening. Screw you gentlemen, and screw this country!” * a silent gunshot is heard * Dan Cooper, or may I say, Sergeant Gordon knew no one would have believed him if he had just made a public announcement. The FBI shuts this case down and kills Dan Cooper so that the real story never reaches the public. The government couldn’t afford the aviation market to witness such a huge hit, so this case remains “unsolved” in the record books. They do fix some of their flaws, but most of the air crimes still pass ahead undetected. This is seen by the whole world on September 11, 2001; when the Twin Towers fell. Hero or a villain, that’s for you to decide.
